###### HW1
Build a simple todo list. No frameworks or libraries, only vanilla JS code. It should have the ability to add new items, 
delete all items, reload data, edit specific items, delete specific items. Data should persist even when closing the browser.

###### HW2
Expanding on previous homework, it should separate the code into a UI/logic layer with the data storage layer. It should 
make use of static module loading to load 2 different data storage strategy modules (local storage, indexed db) using strategy 
design pattern and classes. The data storage modules should be accessed in an asynchronous style with promises.
